# About NeoScout

**NeoScout** is a cyberpunk-inspired tech organization born to empower hackers, pentesters, and tech rebels worldwide. We’re not just another tech crew — we’re a movement that breaks stereotypes, democratizes network security, and builds tools for those who dare to explore the digital frontier. With a passion for open-source innovation and a knack for cyberpunk aesthetics, we’re here to redefine how the world interacts with networks.

## Our Mission

At NeoScout, we believe the digital world should be accessible to everyone, not just corporations or elites. Our mission is to:
- Create **affordable, open-source tools** that put network reconnaissance and security in the hands of the community.
- Foster a **global community** of cyber-raccoons — curious, bold, and collaborative tech enthusiasts.
- Push the boundaries of **innovation** with a hacker’s edge, blending cutting-edge tech with a gritty, cyberpunk vibe.

We’re building a future where anyone with a $50 device and a spark of curiosity can scan, analyze, and take control of their digital environment.

## What We Do

NeoScout is the force behind a suite of powerful tools designed for network exploration and security:
- **ScoutMap**: A network reconnaissance tool for scanning WiFi, pinging hosts, and probing ports, built for hackers by hackers.
- **NetRush**: A fast device discovery tool to map networks in seconds (coming soon).
- **KeySneak**: A BadUSB project for delivering payloads with stealth and style (in development).
- **PuzzleBox**: A playground of vulnerable services for pentesting practice (work in progress).
- **Retro Games**: A nod to the classics with Snake, Tetris, and Tamagotchi on our devices.

Our tools are affordable (~$50), Arduino-compatible, and open-source, ensuring anyone can join the game. Beyond tools, we’re creating a platform for learning, sharing, and collaborating through our website (https://neoscout.ru) and community channels.

## Our Values

- **Accessibility**: High-end tech shouldn’t break the bank. We make powerful tools affordable and open to all.
- **Community**: We’re a global crew of cyber-raccoons, sharing knowledge, ideas, and a love for hacking.
- **Boldness**: We challenge norms, embrace the cyberpunk ethos, and aren’t afraid to stand out.
- **Innovation**: We’re always pushing the envelope, from ESP8266 to custom ESP32 devices and beyond.
